## üîî Motion Detection System with Blynk Integration

This project is a simple yet effective motion detection system using a PIR sensor, ideal for smart home security setups.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- The system uses a **PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor** to detect motion.
- When motion is detected:
  - An **LED blinks** for 5 seconds as a visual alert.
  - A **notification is sent to the user** via the **Blynk mobile app**.
- Users can **remotely enable or disable** the alarm system using a **Blynk button widget**.
- The system connects to the internet via **Wi-Fi**, enabling full remote control and monitoring.

### üì± Features

- Real-time motion detection alerts on your smartphone.
- Remote control via Blynk (toggle alarm ON/OFF).
- Easy to set up and ideal for home security automation.
